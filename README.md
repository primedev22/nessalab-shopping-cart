# Nessa Frontend Test (React)

# Required Tasks

* Create a product listing page using the polaris component library & the provided products data api, (use this [component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/lists-and-tables/resource-list#navigation) to build the product list page)
* Add the ability to search & filter the products by category & sort by ASC / DESC order.
* Create a cart page that will display the products the user has added to the cart with a total price, calculated based on items in the cart (use redux to store the state of the cart)
* Add ability for products in the product list to be added to the cart via an "add to cart" button.


The design of the cart page is totally up to you, you can use the linked component library to create a simple page with a list component to show the cart line items and grand total price.
